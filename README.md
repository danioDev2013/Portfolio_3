This is my portfolio. I wanted to create a portfolio to showcase some of my skills as a web developer. The first thing I did was research for what a portfolio should look like and the functionality of it. 

    1. I created the index.html
    2. Created the navbar, header, aboutme, projects, then the footer
    3. Still working on the more projects, contact me form
    4. Need to work on backend
