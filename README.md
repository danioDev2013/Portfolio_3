This is my updated portfolio. I wanted to create a portfolio to showcase some of my skills as a web developer. The first thing I did was research what portfolios look like and the top web developer portfolios. This way I could get an idea of what I wanted mine to look like. After I looked around, I started sketching what I wanted. The rest was history. I got to work designing the website first with css and bootstrap. After I liked how it looked, javascript came in. I decided to use a little javascript to make the buttons function. Click the link below to view my website.
